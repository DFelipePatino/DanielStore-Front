I built an online store using React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database, hosted on AWS RDS. This project allows users to simulate the entire purchasing process, from browsing products to adding items to the cart and completing a mock checkout.

The platform also features a full CRUD implementation, enabling users to add, update, and delete their own products, making it an interactive marketplace.
